**BaseEx** is a collection of classes for data representation from Base16 (hex) to BasE91.
BaseEx is completely standalone and works client and serverside, with all these common representations in one place.
There are other good solutions for e.g. Base32, Base64, Base85, but BaseEx has them all in one place.
The **Ex** in the name stands for **Ex**ponent (of n) or - as read out loud - for an **X**.
